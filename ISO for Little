Got it — this exact error only means one thing:

Spring Boot cannot find your changelog on the classpath.

And you said your file is NOT inside src/main/..., it’s in the project root.

👉 That location is NEVER added to the classpath, so Spring Boot will never find it, even with the correct path.

Let me show you clearly why and how to fix this specific error.

⸻

❌ WHY your file cannot be found

Spring Boot loads files from classpath, which contains:

src/main/resources/**   → copied into target/classes
src/main/java/**        → compiled into target/classes

Anything outside these folders is ignored.

So this file is INVISIBLE to Spring Boot:

project-root/
    changelog-master.yml   ❌ Spring Boot cannot load this
    src/main/resources/... ✔️ classpath

Even if you set:

spring.liquibase.change-log=classpath:/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

It still fails because the file is not on the classpath.

⸻

✅ HOW TO FIX THE ERROR (only 2 valid ways)

⸻

✅ Fix 1 — Move the file into src/main/resources (recommended)

Place your file here:

src/main/resources/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

Keep your configuration:

spring.liquibase.change-log=classpath:/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

This will 100% fix the error.

⸻

🟡 Fix 2 — Keep the file outside, but tell Maven to copy it to the classpath

If you MUST keep it in the project root:

Add this to your pom.xml:

<build>
    <resources>
        <resource>
            <directory>.</directory>
            <includes>
                <include>changelog-master.yml</include>
            </includes>
            <targetPath>liquibase</targetPath>
        </resource>
        <resource>
            <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
        </resource>
    </resources>
</build>

This will copy:

project-root/changelog-master.yml   
→ target/classes/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

Now Spring Boot will find it at:

classpath:/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

And the error will disappear.

⸻

📌 SUMMARY

Your error exists because:

✔ Spring Boot is looking at the classpath
❌ Your file is not in the classpath

To fix it:

✔ Move file → src/main/resources/liquibase/

OR

✔ Configure Maven to copy it there automatically

If you want, send me the exact structure of your project (screenshot or text like this):

project-root/
  changelog-master.yml
  src/
    main/
      resources/
      java/

I will generate the exact fix.
