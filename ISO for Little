Your error is not coming from the Maven plugin.
It’s coming from Spring Boot’s Liquibase auto-configuration, which expects a file at:

classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml

But Spring Boot cannot find it → so the app crashes before even reaching your Maven plugin config.

⸻

✅ Why Spring Boot complains

Spring Boot automatically looks for:

src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml

(or .yml, both accepted)

If this file is missing → you get:

ChangeLogParseException: classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml does not exist

⸻

✅ Your Maven plugin config does not affect Spring Boot runtime

This part:

<changeLogFile>changelog-master.yml</changeLogFile>
<changeLogDirectory>liquibase</changeLogDirectory>

Only affects liquibase:generateChangeLog, liquibase:update commands in Maven.

It does NOT:
	•	change Spring Boot’s Liquibase location
	•	override the default path
	•	prevent Spring Boot from loading Liquibase at startup

⸻

✔️ Fix the Spring Boot error

You have three possible fixes, choose one:

⸻

Fix 1 — Put the file where Spring Boot expects it (recommended)

Create:

src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml

Or if your filename is .yml, name it:

db.changelog-master.yml

Spring Boot will find it automatically.

⸻

Fix 2 — Change the path in application.properties / application.yml

If you want to use your own file name/location:

application.properties:

spring.liquibase.change-log=classpath:/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

Or YAML:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

Make sure file exists at:

src/main/resources/liquibase/changelog-master.yml


⸻

Fix 3 — Disable Liquibase (not recommended unless you want to turn it off)

application.properties:

spring.liquibase.enabled=false


⸻

⚠️ Important

Your plugin config:

<changeLogFile>changelog-master.yml</changeLogFile>

…means Maven expects this inside the liquibase directory (as you set):

liquibase/changelog-master.yml

But Spring Boot doesn’t care about that Maven directory — it uses the classpath.

⸻

If you want, tell me:

✔️ where your changelog file currently is (full path)
✔️ whether you want Spring Boot to use the Maven folder or move it

I can give you the exact configuration.
