Ah — now it’s crystal clear why you’re still hitting the “file not found” issue. ✅

The key points:
	1.	Your CSVs are outside src/main/resources, e.g.:

bankinfo/
└── liquibase/
    └── data/
        ├── bank_info.csv
        └── bank_agency.csv

	2.	Your Liquibase changelogs are inside src/main/resources/liquibase/
	3.	You tried file:../../liquibase-data/bank_info.csv, but Spring Boot Liquibase still looks in the classpath by default — file: alone doesn’t always switch to filesystem in Spring Boot context.

⸻

✅ Portable Solution That Works on All Environments

We need Liquibase to load the CSV from an absolute filesystem path or an environment-specific path, not from the classpath.

⸻

1️⃣ Move CSVs somewhere outside the classpath (good), e.g.:

bankinfo/
├── liquibase-data/
│   ├── bank_info.csv
│   └── bank_agency.csv
└── src/main/resources/liquibase/
    ├── changelog-master.yaml
    ├── baseline.yaml
    └── changeSet/
        ├── 002-load-bankAgency.yaml
        └── 003-load-bankinfo.yaml


⸻

2️⃣ Define an environment variable or Spring property for the CSV folder

application.yaml:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:liquibase/changelog-master.yaml
    csv-folder: ${LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER:/opt/bankinfo/liquibase-data}

	•	${LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER} → environment variable you can set per environment
	•	/opt/bankinfo/liquibase-data → default path if env variable is not set

✅ This makes it portable: dev, test, prod.

⸻

3️⃣ Use the property in your changeSets

databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: 2-load-bankAgency-data
      author: RHI
      changes:
        - loadData:
            tableName: bank_agency
            file: file:${spring.liquibase.csv-folder}/bank_agency.csv
            separator: ","
            encoding: UTF-8

  - changeSet:
      id: 3-load-bankinfo-data
      author: RHI
      changes:
        - loadData:
            tableName: bank_info
            file: file:${spring.liquibase.csv-folder}/bank_info.csv
            separator: ","
            encoding: UTF-8

	•	file: → forces filesystem load
	•	${spring.liquibase.csv-folder} → resolves per environment
	•	No relative paths, fully portable

⸻

4️⃣ Set environment variable per environment

Example (Linux/macOS):

export LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER=/home/dev/bankinfo/liquibase-data

Example (Windows CMD):

set LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER=C:\bankinfo\liquibase-data

✅ This ensures each environment points to the correct CSV folder.

⸻

5️⃣ Folder structure recap

bankinfo/
├── liquibase-data/               ← CSVs outside resources
│   ├── bank_info.csv
│   └── bank_agency.csv
└── src/main/resources/liquibase/ ← changelogs inside classpath
    ├── changelog-master.yaml
    ├── baseline.yaml
    └── changeSet/
        ├── 002-load-bankAgency.yaml
        └── 003-load-bankinfo.yaml


⸻

✅ Why this works
	1.	Liquibase changelogs are classpath resources → Spring Boot finds them
	2.	CSV files are filesystem resources → file: + property resolves anywhere
	3.	Fully environment-independent, portable, avoids classpath hacks

⸻

If you want, I can rewrite your changelog-master.yaml and changeSets fully portable with the property approach so you can copy-paste them and they’ll work on any machine.

Do you want me to do that?
