Ah! I see exactly what’s happening. The issue isn’t with Liquibase itself — it’s with Spring Boot trying to bind spring.liquibase.csv-folder, which doesn’t exist as a built-in property. That’s why you see:

Reason: The elements [spring.liquibase.csv-folder] were left unbound.

Spring Boot’s LiquibaseProperties only supports its standard properties (change-log, contexts, default-schema, etc.) — it does not know about csv-folder. So trying to put it under spring.liquibase in application.yaml triggers a binding failure.

✅ How to fix this and make it environment-specific
	1.	Define your CSV folder as a custom property, not under spring.liquibase. For example:

# application.yaml
bankinfo:
  csv-folder: ${LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER:./liquibase-data}  # default to ./liquibase-data for local

	•	${LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER} → can be overridden per environment
	•	./liquibase-data → default path for local dev

	2.	Use the property in your changelog:

databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: 2-load-bankAgency-data
      author: RHI
      changes:
        - loadData:
            tableName: bank_agency
            file: file:${bankinfo.csv-folder}/bank_agency.csv
            separator: ","
            encoding: UTF-8

  - changeSet:
      id: 3-load-bankinfo-data
      author: RHI
      changes:
        - loadData:
            tableName: bank_info
            file: file:${bankinfo.csv-folder}/bank_info.csv
            separator: ","
            encoding: UTF-8

Note: file: forces filesystem lookup; ${bankinfo.csv-folder} resolves to your custom property.

	3.	Set the environment variable per environment:

Linux/macOS:

export LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER=/opt/bankinfo/liquibase-data

Windows CMD:

set LIQUIBASE_CSV_FOLDER=C:\bankinfo\liquibase-data

	•	On local, you can leave it as default ./liquibase-data
	•	On server, set the env variable to the correct path

⸻

	4.	Optional: In your local application-dev.yaml:

bankinfo:
  csv-folder: ./liquibase-data

And on server application-prod.yaml:

bankinfo:
  csv-folder: /opt/bankinfo/liquibase-data


⸻

✅ This approach:
	•	Works on any environment
	•	Does not require editing spring.liquibase (avoids binding errors)
	•	Keeps your CSVs outside src/main/resources
	•	Is fully portable and overrides automatically per environment

⸻

If you want, I can rewrite your changelog-master.yaml and changeSets fully portable using this approach so that it works both locally and on the server without touching spring.liquibase.

Do you want me to do that?
