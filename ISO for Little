No problem — your Liquibase ZIP does NOT need to be inside your Spring project.
You can keep Liquibase anywhere on your computer and still run it against your project’s changelog folder.

Here is the cleanest setup for Windows.

⸻

✅ 1. Folder layout (Liquibase and project are separate)

Example:

C:\Tools\liquibase-4.30.0\     ← Liquibase ZIP extracted here
C:\Projects\my-spring-app\     ← Your Spring Boot project

Inside your Spring project, create a Liquibase folder only for the changelogs, not the Liquibase program:

C:\Projects\my-spring-app\liquibase\
    └─ changelog\
          ├─ db.changelog-master.yaml
          ├─ data\ (your big CSV/XML/json files)

👉 This keeps your JAR light, because nothing is inside src/main/resources.

⸻

✅ 2. Run Liquibase CLI from anywhere, but point it to your project’s changelog folder

Open PowerShell or CMD, then:

cd C:\Tools\liquibase-4.30.0\

Then run Liquibase with:

liquibase.bat ^
  --search-path=C:\Projects\my-spring-app\liquibase\changelog ^
  --changeLogFile=db.changelog-master.yaml ^
  update

This works even though Liquibase is in C:\Tools and your project is in C:\Projects.

⸻

🔥 3. If you want, you can set LIQUIBASE_SEARCH_PATH permanently

PowerShell

setx LIQUIBASE_SEARCH_PATH "C:\Projects\my-spring-app\liquibase\changelog"

CMD

setx LIQUIBASE_SEARCH_PATH C:\Projects\my-spring-app\liquibase\changelog

Then you can run:

cd C:\Tools\liquibase-4.30.0\
liquibase.bat update


⸻

🧩 Why this works
	•	Liquibase program = anywhere (not part of the project)
	•	Changelog files = inside your project, but outside your JAR
	•	Your JAR stays small
	•	Liquibase CLI loads the files through --search-path

⸻

✅ If you want, I can generate the exact working command

Tell me the exact paths:
	1.	Where you extracted Liquibase ZIP
(ex: C:\Users\you\Downloads\liquibase-4.30.0)
	2.	Your Spring project path
(ex: C:\Workspace\my-app)

I will generate the exact command you can copy/paste.
