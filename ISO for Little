You’re not crazy — this is a real Liquibase gotcha, and now your error is a different one (but totally fixable). Let’s lock this down cleanly.

⸻

✅ What This Error ACTUALLY Means

You now have this:

ERROR: The file 'classpath:/liquibase/changeSet/001-populate-bankinfo.yaml' was not found.
The file property cannot be configured with a fully qualified path, but must be a relative path

🚨 Root Cause (Important)

When you use include: in Liquibase YAML, the file: value:

❌ MUST NOT start with classpath: or /

Liquibase expects a relative path, resolved from the location of the current changelog file.

So this is ❌ INVALID for include:

file: classpath:/liquibase/changeSet/001-populate-bankinfo.yaml

Liquibase explicitly forbids this.

⸻

✅ ✅ THE EXACT FIX

Since your main changelog already lives in:

src/main/resources/liquibase/db.changelog-master.yaml

And your included files are in:

src/main/resources/liquibase/changeSet/

✅ Your includes MUST be written like this:

databaseChangeLog:
  - include:
      file: baseline.yaml
      relativeToChangelogFile: true

  - include:
      file: changeSet/001-populate-bankinfo.yaml
      relativeToChangelogFile: true

  - include:
      file: changeSet/002-populate-bankagency.yaml
      relativeToChangelogFile: true

✅ Why this works
	•	relativeToChangelogFile: true tells Liquibase:
“Resolve this path relative to the file I’m currently in”
	•	No classpath:
	•	No leading /
	•	No absolute paths

This is the correct and supported Liquibase behavior.

⸻

✅ Your CSV Problem Is Now Also Resolved Automatically

Since:
	•	Your included YAML files now load correctly
	•	And your loadData uses:

file: "liquibase/bank_agency.csv"

Then Liquibase will correctly resolve:

project-root/liquibase/bank_agency.csv

✅ No file:
✅ No resourceaccessor:
✅ No ${} in a URI
✅ No more Illegal character in opaque part
✅ No more file not found

⸻

✅ Final Sanity Checklist (Quick)

Confirm these are ALL true:
	•	✅ No resourceaccessor:file: anywhere in your project
	•	✅ No file: classpath: inside include
	•	✅ All includes use:

relativeToChangelogFile: true


	•	✅ CSV path is:

file: "liquibase/bank_agency.csv"



If all 4 are true → this will run.

⸻

✅ If It Still Fails

Paste these exactly (no screenshots):
	1.	Your full db.changelog-master.yaml
	2.	One full working 001-populate-bankinfo.yaml
	3.	Your exact folder tree (just text)

I will point to the exact wrong line immediately.

⸻

🧠 Final Verdict

You ran into three overlapping Liquibase traps:
	1.	❌ ${} inside file: URI (Java URI crash)
	2.	❌ resourceaccessor:file: misuse
	3.	❌ classpath: not allowed in include

All three are now clearly identified and fixed ✅
You were not missing anything — these are sharp-edge Liquibase behaviors that catch even senior devs.

You’re one clean include fix away from this running.
