Perfect, thanks — now it’s 100% clear what your setup is. ✅
Yes, it IS possible to keep Liquibase outside src/main/resources, but you must explicitly configure searchPath. Right now that’s exactly what’s missing.

Your setup:

\bankinfo\liquibase        ✅ (all changelogs here)
\bankinfo\src             ✅

Spring Boot does NOT scan this folder by default, so Liquibase can’t find baseline.yaml.

⸻

✅ FINAL WORKING SOLUTION (KEEP FILES OUTSIDE src)

✅ 1. Configure search-path in Spring

If you use application.yml:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:liquibase/changelog-master.yaml
    search-path: file:./liquibase

If you use application.properties:

spring.liquibase.change-log=classpath:liquibase/changelog-master.yaml
spring.liquibase.search-path=file:./liquibase

⚠️ This line is mandatory:

spring.liquibase.search-path=file:./liquibase

Without it → Liquibase will NEVER find baseline.yaml outside src.

⸻

✅ 2. Fix your changelog-master.yaml formatting

Your file has a small YAML error (file : with space).
Here is the correct version:

databaseChangeLog:
  - include:
      file: baseline.yaml

  - include:
      file: changeSet/001-populate-bankinfo.yaml

  - include:
      file: changeSet/002-populate-bankagency.yaml

✅ Paths are now relative to \bankinfo\liquibase
✅ No classpath: needed inside includes
✅ YAML indentation is now correct

⸻

✅ 3. Final Required Folder Structure

Your project must look like this:

bankinfo/
├── liquibase/
│   ├── changelog-master.yaml
│   ├── baseline.yaml
│   └── changeSet/
│       ├── 001-populate-bankinfo.yaml
│       └── 002-populate-bankagency.yaml
└── src/

✅ This WILL work
❌ Without search-path → it will always fail

⸻

✅ 4. Clean & Restart (VERY IMPORTANT)

After doing this, run:

mvn clean
mvn spring-boot:run

or in IntelliJ:

Invalidate Caches & Restart


⸻

✅ Why It Was Failing Before

Problem	Result
Liquibase outside src	❌ Not visible
No search-path configured	❌ File not found
YAML typo file :	❌ Parsing error possible

You had all 3 issues combined.

⸻

✅ If It Still Fails

Paste the exact new error stack, and I will fix it immediately — but with this config, it should now start cleanly. ✅
