Got it — this is an important constraint ✅
You can absolutely keep your heavy CSV file outside src while still keeping your Liquibase changelogs inside src/main/resources. This is actually a best-practice setup for large data files.

Let’s separate the two concepts:

⸻

✅ ✅ CORRECT & SAFE ARCHITECTURE

✅ Liquibase changelogs → INSIDE classpath

src/main/resources/liquibase/
├── changelog-master.yaml
├── baseline.yaml
└── changeSet/
    └── 003-load-heavy-csv.yaml

✅ Heavy CSV file → OUTSIDE src

bankinfo/
├── liquibase-data/
│   └── big-file.csv   ✅ very large file here
└── src/

This is 100% supported by Liquibase.

⸻

✅ HOW TO LOAD AN EXTERNAL CSV FILE

Inside your Liquibase changeSet:

databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: load-big-csv
      author: you
      changes:
        - loadData:
            file: ../liquibase-data/big-file.csv
            tableName: bank_info
            separator: ;
            encoding: UTF-8

✅ This uses a filesystem-relative path
✅ The CSV is NOT inside the JAR
✅ Works perfectly for very large files
✅ No Spring config needed
✅ No search-path needed

Liquibase resolves CSV paths from the working directory of the application (bankinfo/).

⸻

✅ FINAL REQUIRED CONFIG

application.yaml

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:liquibase/changelog-master.yaml

✅ No search-path
✅ No external Liquibase folder
✅ No Spring binding error
✅ Fully production-safe

⸻

✅ WHY THIS WORKS (AND YOUR PREVIOUS APPROACH FAILED)

Item	Should be in classpath?	Can be external?
changelog-master.yaml	✅ YES	❌ NO
baseline.yaml	✅ YES	❌ NO
changeset yaml	✅ YES	❌ NO
Heavy CSV file	❌ NO	✅ YES

Spring Boot requires changelogs in classpath
Liquibase allows data files anywhere on disk

⸻

✅ IF YOUR CSV PATH STILL FAILS

Use an absolute path as a test:

file: C:/bankinfo/liquibase-data/big-file.csv

If that works → your relative path needs adjustment.

⸻

✅ TL;DR (Straight Answer)

❌ You cannot keep Liquibase YAML outside src in Spring Boot
✅ You can and should keep your heavy CSV outside src
✅ Use relative filesystem paths in loadData
✅ This avoids huge JAR files and memory issues

⸻

If you want, paste your actual loadData changeSet and your real folder paths — I’ll correct the exact file: value for you so it works on the first run. ✅
