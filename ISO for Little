This is a Liquibase classpath vs filesystem path problem. Liquibase (when run via Spring Boot) only looks on the Spring classpath, not arbitrary folders on disk — and your baseline.yaml is outside src, so it is not on the classpath.

That’s exactly what this error is telling you:

The file baseline.yaml was not found in the configured search path:
– Spring classpath

⸻

✅ What’s Going Wrong

You currently have:

./liquibase/changelog-master.yaml
./liquibase/baseline.yaml   <-- outside src

And inside changelog-master.yaml you probably have:

databaseChangeLog:
  - include:
      file: baseline.yaml

When Spring Boot runs, it only searches:

src/main/resources

Anything outside src/ is invisible at runtime.

⸻

✅ Correct Fix (Best Practice)

1. Move both files into src/main/resources

Your structure should be:

src/main/resources/
└── liquibase/
    ├── changelog-master.yaml
    └── baseline.yaml


⸻

2. Reference the file correctly in changelog-master.yaml

Since they are in the same folder:

databaseChangeLog:
  - include:
      file: liquibase/baseline.yaml

✅ Always use a classpath-relative path, not a filesystem path

⸻

3. Ensure your Spring config points to the master file correctly

In application.yml or application.properties:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:liquibase/changelog-master.yaml

OR

spring.liquibase.change-log=classpath:liquibase/changelog-master.yaml


⸻

⚠️ What Will NOT Work

These will all fail in Spring Boot:

❌ ./liquibase/baseline.yaml
❌ Absolute disk paths
❌ Files outside src/main/resources
❌ classpath: missing on the master changelog

⸻

✅ If You Must Keep the File Outside src (Not Recommended)

You would need to configure:

spring:
  liquibase:
    search-path: file:./liquibase

AND use:

- include:
    file: baseline.yaml

But again — this is fragile and not recommended for real apps.

⸻

✅ Summary

Problem	Fix
baseline.yaml outside src	Move it into src/main/resources/liquibase
Liquibase can’t find file	Use classpath: paths
include: baseline.yaml fails	Change to liquibase/baseline.yaml


⸻

If you want, paste your:
	•	changelog-master.yaml
	•	Your project folder structure

and I’ll correct the exact paths for you line-by-line.
