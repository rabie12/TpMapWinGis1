Ah — now it’s clear why it still fails. The recurring error means Spring Boot cannot see your liquibase/changelog-master.yml file at runtime, even with file:./…. Let’s go through the root causes and a reliable solution.

⸻

1️⃣ Why this happens

file:./liquibase/changelog-master.yml resolves relative to the current working directory, not the project folder.

Depending on how you run your Spring Boot app, the working directory can be:
	•	IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse): often target/classes or a run configuration-specific folder
	•	Command line: usually the folder from which you run java -jar ...
	•	Docker / CI/CD: the folder inside the container

If the liquibase folder is not in that working directory, Liquibase cannot find it.

⸻

2️⃣ How to fix reliably

There are three ways, pick one:

⸻

Option A — Move the folder inside src/main/resources
	•	Put your changelog and data under:

src/main/resources/liquibase/changelog-master.yml
src/main/resources/liquibase/data/...

	•	Config in application.yml:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

✅ Works everywhere, automatically packaged in the JAR.

⚠ Only use if file size is reasonable (won’t bloat the JAR).

⸻

Option B — Keep external folder, use absolute path
	•	Example:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: file:/C:/Users/you/bankinfo/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

or Linux/Mac:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: file:/home/user/bankinfo/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

✅ Works anywhere that folder exists.

⚠ Not portable between environments without changing the path.

⸻

Option C — Keep external folder, use a dynamic environment variable (recommended)
	•	application.yml:

spring:
  liquibase:
    change-log: ${LIQUIBASE_CHANGELOG:file:./liquibase/changelog-master.yml}

	•	Set environment variable per environment:

export LIQUIBASE_CHANGELOG=file:/path/to/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

or in Windows CMD:

set LIQUIBASE_CHANGELOG=file:C:\path\to\liquibase\changelog-master.yml

✅ Most flexible: works in all environments without editing the code.

⸻

3️⃣ Quick diagnostic

Before running, check:

Windows CMD / PowerShell:

dir .\liquibase\changelog-master.yml

Linux / Mac:

ls ./liquibase/changelog-master.yml

	•	If the file is not found → the working directory is wrong.
	•	You must either move the folder or adjust the working directory.

⸻

4️⃣ IDE-specific fix (IntelliJ)
	1.	Go to Run → Edit Configurations → Your App
	2.	Check Working directory
	3.	Make sure it points to the folder that contains liquibase, e.g.:

C:\Users\you\bankinfo

	4.	Apply → Run.

⸻

✅ Summary
	•	Your error is not Liquibase — it’s path/working directory.
	•	Either:
	1.	Put files in src/main/resources → classpath:
	2.	Use absolute file path → file:
	3.	Use env variable → ${LIQUIBASE_CHANGELOG}
	•	Ensure working directory contains your liquibase folder if you use relative file:./.

If you want, I can write a ready-to-use application.yml setup that works on all environments, fully externalized, so you never have this error again. Do you want me to do that?
