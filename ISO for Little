👌 Now the problem is 100% clear:

You already executed the baseline changeset in production, so Liquibase marked it as executed in DATABASECHANGELOG in production, but NOT in your local machine.

So in your local environment, Liquibase is trying to execute baseline.yaml::1-baseline-schema::RHI again — and that changeset creates a table that already exists → causing:

Table 'users' already exists  

This is expected.

⸻

✅ Correct fix: Tell Liquibase that the baseline changeset is already executed

Since baseline has already been applied in production, and your local DB already has the tables, you must mark the changeset as executed WITHOUT running it.

This is done with:

Solution: liquibase changelog-sync

Run:

.\liquibase.bat ^
  --search-path="C:\RHABACHI\IdeaProjects\bankinfo\liquibase" ^
  --changelog-file=changelogMaster.yaml ^
  changelog-sync

✔ Marks ALL pending changesets as executed
✔ Does not run them
✔ Fixes the “table already exists” problem
✔ Makes local environment consistent with prod

⸻

❗ DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE THE CHANGESET

Do NOT:
	•	delete the changeset
	•	comment it out
	•	change its ID/author
	•	modify the SQL inside

Because production already has the baseline checksums.

⸻

🔍 Why this happened

You ran baseline earlier on production using:

✔ changelogSync or
✔ update that executed the baseline

But in local dev, you are starting from zero; so Liquibase attempts to run the baseline schema creation → but tables already exist → conflict.

⸻

🔧 Optional: If you want to sync only one changeset

Instead of syncing them all:

.\liquibase.bat changelog-sync-one ^
  --changeset-id=1-baseline-schema ^
  --changeset-author=RHI


⸻

🧨 Important safety note

Never delete or edit the baseline changeset after it has been executed in production.
Always use sync commands.

🙋 If you want, I can verify exactly which changesets need syncing

Just run:

.\liquibase.bat history

and paste the output.

I’ll tell you exactly what to sync and what not to sync.
