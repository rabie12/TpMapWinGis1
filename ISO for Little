Yes — you can load files that are outside of src and outside the JAR, and you do NOT need to include them in the JAR.

This is a common requirement for large Liquibase changelogs, CSV data, or environment-specific files.

Spring Boot can load files from outside the classpath — you simply need to use the file: prefix instead of classpath:.

✅ How to load Liquibase changelogs from outside the JAR

If your folder is:

\bankinfo\liquibase\data

And your changelog is:

\bankinfo\liquibase\changelog-master.yml

You can point Liquibase directly to the file system:

application.properties

spring.liquibase.change-log=file:./liquibase/changelog-master.yml

If your app runs from bankinfo/, this works immediately.

You can also use an absolute path:

spring.liquibase.change-log=file:/C:/bankinfo/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

or on Linux:

spring.liquibase.change-log=file:/home/user/bankinfo/liquibase/changelog-master.yml

📌 Allowed file prefixes in Spring Boot for Liquibase

Prefix	Meaning
classpath:	Load from inside JAR / resources
file:	Load from external filesystem
http:	Load from URL (not recommended)

So for external files, always use file:.

⸻

💡 Example folder structure

bankinfo/
  src/
    main/
      resources/
        application.properties
  liquibase/
    changelog-master.yml
    data/
       huge_file.sql
       large_seed_data.csv

Nothing inside bankinfo/liquibase/ goes into the JAR — but Spring can still read it using file: paths.

⸻

🟢 Loading nested changelog files

Inside changelog-master.yml, you can also reference external files:

databaseChangeLog:
  - include:
      file: file:./liquibase/data/init-01.yaml
  - include:
      file: file:./liquibase/data/init-02.yaml

The file: prefix works anywhere Liquibase supports file:.

⸻

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT

Liquibase must start from a real file.

That means your main file must be:

spring.liquibase.change-log=file:...

You cannot mix:
	•	master file in classpath
	•	includes outside
unless you use file: for includes.

⸻

✔️ Summary

⭐ Yes, you can load Liquibase files stored outside of src.

⭐ They do NOT need to be packaged in the JAR.

⭐ Use file: instead of classpath:.

If you want, send me your exact real path of:
	•	the changelog master file
	•	the data/ folder

and I will generate the correct spring.liquibase.change-log= configuration for your system.
