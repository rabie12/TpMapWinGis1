The root cause is your <mirrors> section in settings.xml:

<mirrors>
  <mirror>
    <id>internal</id>
    <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
    <url>http://artifactory.olkypay.local/artifactory/libs-release</url>
  </mirror>
</mirrors>

mirrorOf="*" tells Maven to redirect all repositories (including Maven Central) to your internal Artifactory. That’s why even after adding Maven Central in <repositories> or <pluginRepositories>, Maven never reaches it—it’s being blocked by the mirror.

You have two options:

⸻

Option 1: Limit the mirror

Change your mirror so it only mirrors your internal repos, not everything:

<mirrors>
  <mirror>
    <id>internal</id>
    <mirrorOf>libs-release,libs-snapshot</mirrorOf>
    <url>http://artifactory.olkypay.local/artifactory/libs-release</url>
  </mirror>
</mirrors>

	•	mirrorOf="libs-release,libs-snapshot" → only redirects internal repos.
	•	Maven Central will now be reachable.

⸻

Option 2: Bypass mirror for Maven Central

Keep mirrorOf="*" but add an exclusion for Maven Central:

<mirror>
  <id>internal</id>
  <mirrorOf>*,!central</mirrorOf>
  <url>http://artifactory.olkypay.local/artifactory/libs-release</url>
</mirror>

	•	*,!central → mirrors everything except Maven Central.

⸻

After either change, clear cached plugin failures:

mvn clean install -U

This will allow Maven to fetch maven-clean-plugin:3.2.0 from Maven Central.

⸻

If you want, I can rewrite your settings.xml fully so both your internal Artifactory and Maven Central work together without any plugin resolution issues. Do you want me to do that?
