Ah! I see exactly what’s happening. This is similar to the previous Maven plugin issue: Maven cannot resolve the springmvc-raml-parser:0.9.1_FORKED dependency for your springmvc-raml-plugin. Let me break it down carefully.

⸻

Problem Analysis
	1.	In your pom.xml, the plugin is declared like this:

<plugin>
    <groupId>com.phoenixnap.oss</groupId>
    <artifactId>springmvc-raml-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.1</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.phoenixnap.oss</groupId>
            <artifactId>springmvc-raml-parser</artifactId>
            <version>0.9.1_FORKED</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>

	•	Notice the version: 0.9.1_FORKED.
	•	This is not a standard Maven Central version. It’s either a custom fork published in your internal Artifactory or maybe not published at all.

	2.	Because your settings.xml mirrors everything to internal Artifactory, Maven looks there first:

http://artifactory.olkypay.local/artifactory/libs-release

	•	The dependency is not found → build fails.

⸻

Solutions

Option 1: Use the original version from Maven Central
	•	The official Maven Central version is 0.9.1 (no _FORKED).
	•	Update your plugin dependency to:

<plugin>
    <groupId>com.phoenixnap.oss</groupId>
    <artifactId>springmvc-raml-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.1</version>
</plugin>

	•	Remove the <dependencies> section that points to _FORKED.
	•	This works if you don’t need the forked features.

⸻

Option 2: Publish _FORKED to your Artifactory
	•	If you must use _FORKED, make sure the jar and its pom are available in:

http://artifactory.olkypay.local/artifactory/libs-release/com/phoenixnap/oss/springmvc-raml-parser/0.9.1_FORKED/

	•	You can install it manually in local .m2 with:

mvn install:install-file \
    -DgroupId=com.phoenixnap.oss \
    -DartifactId=springmvc-raml-parser \
    -Dversion=0.9.1_FORKED \
    -Dpackaging=jar \
    -Dfile=/path/to/springmvc-raml-parser-0.9.1_FORKED.jar

	•	Or deploy it to your internal Artifactory so CI builds can fetch it.

⸻

Option 3: Temporarily bypass internal mirror
	•	You can temporarily bypass the mirror and fetch the plugin and its dependencies from Maven Central using:

mvn clean install -U -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/m2

	•	This avoids Artifactory entirely for this run (useful for testing).

⸻

✅ Recommendation
	1.	If you don’t need the forked parser → remove _FORKED dependency entirely and rely on Maven Central.
	2.	If you need _FORKED → ensure it’s deployed in Artifactory or install it locally.
	3.	After fixing the dependency, always force update:

mvn clean install -U

I can also give you a ready-to-use fixed plugin snippet for your POM that works with Maven Central and doesn’t require _FORKED. This will make your build work immediately.

Do you want me to do that?
