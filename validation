Ah, this is a classic Liquibase schema evolution case. Your error:

Data too long for column 'details'

happens because the column is still VARCHAR(1000) in the database, but your entity is now using @Column(columnDefinition = "LONGTEXT"). You need a new Liquibase changeset to alter the column type.

Here’s a proper way to do it:

- changeSet:
    id: 20251120-01-update-details-column
    author: rhabachi
    changes:
      - modifyDataType:
          tableName: document
          columnName: details
          newDataType: LONGTEXT

✅ Notes
	1.	ID: Make it unique and meaningful (I used 20251120-01-update-details-column for today’s date).
	2.	modifyDataType: This will alter the existing column without dropping the table.
	3.	Make sure the liquibase.properties or your Spring Boot datasource points to the correct database.

After this, you can run:

mvn liquibase:update

or let Spring Boot run the migration on startup. Your details column will now support large text, avoiding the Data too long error.

If you want, I can also write the full Liquibase YAML snippet including the context for multiple environments to make it production-ready. Do you want me to do that?
