“I’m Rabie Habachi, a Fintech Software Engineer with around eight years of experience in backend and full-stack development. 
I’m currently working at the Fintech Institute, leading the development of an institutional crypto project and supporting 
the migration of core banking systems using Java 17/21, Spring Boot 3, and MariaDB.

Previously, I worked with the European Parliament in an international, multi-team environment on complex Java and Angular systems, 
and before that at Atos Worldline, where I contributed to a Belgian brokerage platform managing mortgage and consumer loans,
handling both development and business-rule analysis.

Outside of work, I’m very active: I play football with a local team in Gasperich, and I enjoy running — 
this year I completed my first marathon relay at the ING Night Marathon Luxembourg, running the 13 km segment with my team.
I recently started hiking as well, with two beautiful mountain hikes in the Lucerne region. I love traveling and have visited around 30 countries; 
this year I fulfilled a personal dream by traveling to the United States, visiting New York and Florida. And that’s basically me.

About expectations

Thank you for your time today. I’m very excited about what you’re building, and I sincerely hope I’ll get the opportunity to contribute. 
This role is definitely one of my top priorities.
