Great — that means your backend is fine, and the issue is entirely on Bruno.

Bruno is sending the wrong Content-Type header:

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8

Your endpoint does not accept form-urlencoded, so DEV rejects it with:

Content-Type ... is not supported

Locally your app is more permissive, so it works.

✅ Fix Bruno in 5 seconds

👉 Remove the Content-Type header

OR

👉 change it to application/json

Your request does NOT send a body, so you do NOT need any Content-Type at all.

⸻

🔧 Steps in Bruno UI
	1.	Open your request
	2.	Go to Headers
	3.	Delete this line:

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

	4.	Do NOT set a body
	5.	Hit Send

⸻

🟢 After this, DEV will respond normally.

🚀 Why this works

Spring Boot logic:
	•	If no body → no need for Content-Type
	•	If Content-Type = form-urlencoded → Spring expects form values
	•	Your controller doesn’t accept that → throws HttpMediaTypeNotSupportedException
	•	Your global handler catches it → returns 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR

Bruno is the only client sending this wrong header → that’s why only Bruno fails.

If you want, I can show you how to configure your GlobalExceptionHandler to return a clean 415 Unsupported Media Type instead of 500.
