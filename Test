A HTTP 401 Unauthorized error from the SEPA Tools API (e.g., at https://rest.sepatools.eu/validate_iban/{iban}) generally means the request was received but the credentials were not accepted. Here are possible causes + a checklist to debug:

⸻

✅ What to check
	1.	Credentials
	•	Confirm the username & password you’re passing to headers.setBasicAuth(username, secret) are correct, and belong to the correct environment (sandbox / production) as per SEPA Tools.
	•	Make sure there are no extra spaces/newline characters when reading from your config.
	•	Confirm the account hasn’t been disabled, expired, or locked.
	2.	Endpoint vs. Credentials Scope
	•	You noted there is a “dummy” endpoint (/validate_iban_dummy/...) which is free to call and may work with the same credentials. If you used credentials created for dummy usage but call the actual endpoint (/validate_iban/...), maybe access is restricted.
	•	Check whether your subscription/plan allows calls to /validate_iban/ (versus dummy). The doc says the dummy endpoint is free; the real one may require a paid usage or specific account configuration.  ￼
	•	Confirm you are calling the correct base URL and path as required by the docs (for example: https://rest.sepatools.eu/validate_iban/{iban}) and not accidentally hitting another domain or path.
	3.	HTTP Request Setup
	•	Using WebClient.get().uri(valditeIbanURL, iban.trim()): check the URL is resolved correctly (no typo: you show valditeIbanURL but docs say validate_iban).
	•	Ensure the baseUrl passed into WebClient builder is correct (looks like from configService.getProperties("sepa.url")).
	•	Confirm that BasicAuth header is indeed sent and not overridden by proxy or other header manipulations.
	•	If behind a proxy (you log proxy settings), ensure the proxy is not dropping/altering the Authorization header.
	4.	Usage of GET vs POST
	•	According to docs, the validate_iban endpoint supports GET and POST.  ￼ You are using GET, which is valid—but if for your account only POST is allowed (e.g., for paid tier) you might get 401/403 instead of 405. Check the plan.
	5.	Account / Plan Changes
	•	It’s possible SEPA Tools changed their API access policy (e.g., disabled your credentials, changed plan limits, required IP whitelisting or additional header) without your immediate knowledge.
	•	Contact their support to check “Is my account active?” and “Does my credential still have access to validate_iban (not only dummy)?”
	6.	Logging and Replay
	•	Your error log will show status = 401 and maybe response body/headers. Inspect ex.getResponseBodyAsString() and ex.getHeaders() (as you log) to see if there is a message like “invalid credentials”, “account not active”, “quota exceeded”.
	•	Try a curl or Postman call outside of your WebClient code using the same credentials and endpoint to isolate code vs account issue.

🛠 Suggested next steps
	•	Use Postman (or curl) to call:

curl -u username:secret "https://rest.sepatools.eu/validate_iban_dummy/AL90208110080000001039531801"

That uses their dummy endpoint which should succeed (free). If this fails with 401, it’s almost certainly an account/credential issue.

	•	Then try the real endpoint with your credentials but maybe a valid IBAN:

curl -u username:secret "https://rest.sepatools.eu/validate_iban/IE92BOFI90001710027952"

See if it returns 200 or 401.

	•	If standalone call works, compare the WebClient request to ensure exactly matching BasicAuth header, endpoint, method, path.
	•	If standalone call fails, contact SEPA Tools and ask: “Are my credentials active for validate_iban (not only dummy) and is the account still valid?”
	•	Also check if IP restrictions, usage quota or plan renewal caused access being revoked.

🚩 Summary

The 401 error strongly suggests authentication / access rather than a bug in your client code (though typo in path/method could contribute). Since you mention “checked my credentials” already, likely possibilities are: the credentials are not valid for production REST endpoint (only dummy), or the account/plan changed and no longer authorizes the validate_iban endpoint. Using a direct curl/Postman call should clarify.

If you like, I can check for any recent changes in SEPA Tools API policy (or check their API status) and we can refine the troubleshooting further. Would you like me to do that?
