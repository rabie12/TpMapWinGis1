Below is exactly what you asked for:

⸻

✅ 1. Why your jobs run twice

You currently have two instances of the same application running on your dev server:

Instance A → Java 17

Instance B → Java 8

Both instances load the same Mediator configuration, meaning every scheduled job executes twice (once per instance).
This creates:
	•	✔ Double PACS integrations
	•	✔ Double “ORDRES” selections
	•	✔ Double PayZen processing
	•	✔ Double IBAN retrieval
	•	❌ High CPU usage
	•	❌ Database locks / duplicates
	•	❌ Risk of sending/processing files twice

⸻

✅ 2. What to do

If you want only one instance to run all jobs, you must:

A. Disable the scheduler on one of the applications

by setting a property in its config:

mediator.enabled=false

or disable Spring scheduler:

spring.task.scheduling.enabled=false

or simply stop the Java 8 instance entirely if not needed.

⸻

⸻

✅ 4. What you must cut

If you want to stop duplicated jobs, disable one of the two instances:

Option A — disable on Java 8 app only

Add in Java 8’s application.properties:

mediator.enabled=false
spring.task.scheduling.enabled=false

Option B — shut down the Java 8 server

If it’s a legacy app, it’s safer.

⸻

⚠️ Why you should NOT keep both apps running
	•	Jobs like ORDRES, SCT, PACS integration are NOT idempotent
	•	Running them twice will:
	•	duplicate PACS generation
	•	double send SEPA files
	•	corrupt SOLR indexes
	•	double run IBAN imports
	•	cause DB inconsistencies
	•	overload CPU
	•	spam external systems (PayZen, Swift, BB)

⸻

✅ If you want, I can also:

✔ Build a clean table summarizing all jobs
✔ Recommend which jobs to disable and why
✔ Suggest a one-instance-only lock mechanism (Redis, DB lock, etc.)
✔ Analyze CPU usage based on your logs

Just tell me.
