You can review exactly why the PKIX (SSL certificate validation) failed by enabling Maven SSL debug logging.
This will show the full certificate chain, what is missing, and why Java refuses the connection.

Here are the places and commands to review the PKIX path building error in full detail:

⸻

✅ 1. Run Maven with full SSL debug output

This is the most complete way to see the PKIX error.

Command (Windows)

mvn clean install -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake,x509 -X

Command (Linux/Mac)

JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake,x509" mvn clean install -X

This will print:
	•	certificates sent by Artifactory
	•	certificates trusted locally
	•	which certificate failed
	•	the exact step where PKIX path building stops
	•	the issuer that is missing from your truststore

Look for lines like:

trustStore is: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\lib\security\cacerts
checking server certificate chain
PKIX path building failed: ...


⸻

✅ 2. Check which truststore Maven is actually using

Run:

mvn -X | findstr "trustStore"

or on PowerShell:

mvn -X | Select-String "trustStore"

You’ll see something like:

trustStore is: C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17\lib\security\cacerts

➡️ This is the JDK where you must import your Artifactory certificate.

⸻

✅ 3. Check if the certificate is already inside the truststore

Use:

keytool -list -keystore "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\lib\security\cacerts" -storepass changeit

Search for your certificate:

Alias name: artifactory-new

If it is missing → PKIX fails.

⸻

✅ 4. Check if IntelliJ is using a different JDK than your terminal

In IntelliJ:

File → Settings → Build Tools → Maven → JDK for importer

Often:
	•	Terminal uses JDK 17
	•	IntelliJ uses bundled JDK 21

➡️ The certificate must be imported in the JDK used by Maven in IntelliJ.

🔍 Summary – Where you can “review the PKIX”

You can inspect PKIX errors in these places:

Where to check	What you get
mvn -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake,x509	Full certificate chain analysis
mvn -X	Shows which truststore Maven uses
keytool -list -keystore cacerts	Validates if the cert is correctly imported
IntelliJ Maven JDK settings	Verifies the correct JDK truststore
Browser → Click padlock → Certificate info	Check expiration, issuer, and chain

If you want

I can help you:

✔ decode the SSL debug output
✔ tell you exactly which certificate is missing
✔ verify your Artifactory certificate
✔ give you the exact import command for your JDK

Just paste the part of the error starting with:

*** Certificate chain

from your -Djavax.net.debug output.
