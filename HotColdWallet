That warning is coming from Spring Boot’s default security auto-configuration. It appears because Spring Security is on your classpath but you haven’t defined your own users yet.

You have three clean options to remove it, depending on what you want.

⸻

✅ Option 1: Define Your Own Username & Password (Recommended for Dev)

This keeps security enabled but removes the generated password log.

In application.properties:

spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=admin123

or in application.yml:

spring:
  security:
    user:
      name: admin
      password: admin123

✅ This completely removes:

Using generated security password


⸻

✅ Option 2: Disable Security Completely (If You Don’t Need It)

If you don’t use Spring Security at all:

In your main application class:

@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {
    org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.servlet.SecurityAutoConfiguration.class
})
public class BankInfoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(BankInfoApplication.class, args);
    }
}

✅ Removes:
	•	The warning
	•	Login page
	•	All security filters

⚠ Only do this if your app truly doesn’t need security.

⸻

✅ Option 3: Hide Only the Log (Not Recommended, but Possible)

This just silences the message, without fixing the root issue.

logging.level.org.springframework.security=ERROR

⚠ This hides important security logs too — use only if necessary.

✅ Best Practice Summary

Use Case	Best Option
Development with login	✅ Option 1
No security at all	✅ Option 2
Temporary log silence	⚠ Option 3
