Here’s a clean, professional STAR-format example based on the situation you described. I filled in missing details and structured it so it sounds clear and interview-ready. If you want it shorter or tailored to a behavioral question (“Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict,” “Tell me about a time you handled confusion in a project,” etc.), I can adjust it.

STAR Example: Deployment Confusion Due to Missed Database Script

Situation:
I was working on a shared project with several senior developers, and we often deployed our features at the same time. On one release, a colleague forgot to run an important database script. After deployment, 
unexpected bugs appeared in another part of the system, even though the codebases were separate. This created confusion, because we couldn’t immediately tell whose functionality was causing the issue. 
I was working on the Medical Score module for Finagora GDPR rules, so at first it was unclear whether the issue originated from my work or elsewhere.

Action:
The first thing I did was focus on understanding the problem rather than jumping to conclusions. I coordinated with the team to recreate the issue and compared the behavior with the expected logic from my module.
Once I confirmed my part was functioning as designed, I reached out to the colleague responsible for the related area and walked through the deployment checklist with him. That’s when we discovered the missing database script.

After identifying the root cause, I proposed improving our process to prevent similar problems in the future. I helped create a simple pre-deployment checklist that included items like schema updates,
script execution, and dependency verification. We also added a short, mandatory pre-release sync meeting so everyone was aligned.

Result:
The issue was quickly resolved once the missing script was executed. Our deployments became smoother afterward, and confusion during release cycles dropped significantly.
The checklist and sync meeting are now standard practice for the team, improving reliability and reducing last-minute surprises.
