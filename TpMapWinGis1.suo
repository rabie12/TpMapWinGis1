Got it — so at Atos Worldline, you were working on a Belgian brokerage platform that managed crédits immobiliers (mortgage loans) and crédits à la consommation (consumer loans) — not IPOs.

Here’s your updated, refined and brief self-introduction with that correction included:

⸻

I’m Rabie Habachi, a Fintech Software Engineer with around eight years of experience in backend and full-stack development. I’m currently working at the Fintech Institute, leading the development of an institutional crypto project and supporting the migration of core banking systems using Java 17/21, Spring Boot 3, and MariaDB.

Previously, I worked with the European Parliament, collaborating in an international environment on complex Java and Angular systems, and earlier at Atos Worldline, where I contributed to a Belgian brokerage platform managing mortgage and consumer loans, handling both development and business-rule analysis.

I’m passionate about technology, innovation, and teamwork. Outside of work, I love running 5–10K weekly, playing football with my local team in Gasperich, and traveling — I’ve visited around 30 countries.

Today, I’m looking for a long-term role in fintech, in a company that encourages innovation, collaboration, and growth, where I can contribute and build something meaningful for the future.

Would you like me to make a shorter (30–45 second) spoken version — something that sounds natural for a first interview answer?
